This project revolves around pytorch and the MNIST dataset. The program trains a model to recognise handwritten digits. The user is then able to input a letter via a drawing in a
pygame window, the model will then try to predict what digit the user has eneterd.
Sidenote: This project will be reworked with a better working GUI and better trained model in the near future.
Particular problems with the model right now is recognising pictures with lower pixel density/intensity which seems to affect recognition of 7s and 9s.
